# Modern Brewing Data Repository

## Overview

This repository is an open-source project designed to replace outdated data structures with modern, lightweight templates aimed at improving flexibility, scalability, and efficiency. By adopting streamlined JSON templates and other widely supported formats, this project enhances data connections, computation speed, and ease of integration with contemporary technologies. 

We also provide **bidirectional converters** to enable seamless migration between legacy formats and the modern templates available here. However, converting from modern templates to older formats may result in **data loss**, as legacy structures often lack the depth and flexibility of these new designs.

## Features

- **Modern Data Templates**: Designed for improved clarity, ease of use, and broader applications.
- **Bidirectional Converters**: Tools to transform existing files into modern templates and vice versa.
- **Flexibility**: Templates adaptable for homebrewing, commercial brewing, and industrial automation.
- **Scalability**: Supports small-scale projects to enterprise-level systems.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for faster data processing and IoT connectivity.

## Current and Upcoming Templates

### Template Directories
Each directory includes the following components:
- **`data_template`**: Defines the structure of the data in JSON format.
- **`full_example`**: Fully populated examples demonstrating real-world usage.
- **`documentation`**: Detailed explanations of the structure and usage.

### Directories

- **`brew_recipe/`**: Defines data structures for representing beer recipes with extensive metadata for modern brewing needs.
- **`brew_ble_beacon/`**: Templates for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon protocols, designed to transmit brewing telemetry.
- **`brew_ble_gatt/`**: Optimized structures for Bluetooth GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) communication with brewing hardware.
- **`beer_report/`**: Standardized formats for generating reports on brewing processes, including fermentation logs, quality checks, and more.

## Legacy Support

The repository aims to replace outdated data standards with superior alternatives. While bidirectional converters are included to ease transition, users should be cautious about data loss when converting from modern templates to legacy formats.
